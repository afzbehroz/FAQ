      <div class="title" id="section1">What is JSON?</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based format
          for exchanging data. It's easy to read and write for humans and easy
          for machines to parse and generate, making it ideal for web APIs and
          data transfer. JSON uses key-value pairs and arrays, similar to
          JavaScript objects..

      <div class="title" id="section2">What are APIs?</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software
          applications to communicate with each other. It defines a set of rules
          and protocols for building and interacting with software applications,
          enabling them to request and exchange data or functionality. APIs are
          widely used for integrating different systems and enabling the
          development of complex software ecosystems.

      <div class="title" id="section3">What is Fetch?</div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>
          The `fetch` function in JavaScript is a modern way to make network
          requests, such as fetching data from a server. It returns a promise
          that resolves to the response of the request. `fetch` is more powerful
          and flexible compared to older methods like `XMLHttpRequest`,
          supporting features like promises, async/await, and easier handling of
          various types of data, such as JSON.
